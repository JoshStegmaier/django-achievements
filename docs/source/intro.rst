Catchphrase
------------

Django-achievement's goal is to provide a framework and an engine for handling User achievements in 
a django app.

-------------------
What does it mean ?
-------------------
It means two things that you can guess from the words i'm using :

 * It's a framework : 
   It means you can define classes that will be called and taken into account
   by the application.

 * and it's an engine : 
   It means that there's an entity responsible for checking and managing as a whole
   every achievement that can be handle by the system. Bonus : You can call it when you 
   need to;
